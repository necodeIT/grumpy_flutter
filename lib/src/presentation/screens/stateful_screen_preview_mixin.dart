/// Use this mixin when a screen preview needs to own controllers, animations,
/// or other resources whose lifecycle should be managed by Flutter. Implement
/// [createPreviewState] instead of [Screen.buildPreview]. The current
/// [RouteContext] is available to the state through `widget.route`.

/// By default, it is preserved when the route context changes. Override
/// [createPreviewKey] when a route change should create a fresh state.

///
/// ```dart
/// class ReportScreen extends Screen with StatefulScreenPreview {
///   @override
///   Widget buildContent(BuildContext context, RouteContext route) {
///     return const Text('Report');
///   }
///
///   @override
///   ScreenPreviewState createPreviewState() => _ReportPreviewState();
/// }
///
/// class _ReportPreviewState extends ScreenPreviewState {
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     return Text('Loading ${widget.route.fullPath}');
///   }
/// }
/// ```
